**Communication, Design, Marketing and Development**

The companies that fall under the **Digital Enterprise** program are because they have clear ideas, create a brand.

**Digital Enterprise**, an IT project that brings companies in their digital growth, marketing, communication, internal project management and designer development.

The main action is to want to give an innovative, commercial and organizational change to your business.

This project adheres to the GitHub platform, where archives are made using repositories with command lines. DigitalEnterprise is divided into two sections:
* It is the graphic/marketing part using the best drawing tools, in curating any detail.
* It is the part of development that realizes projects in open source, using programming languages.

This working methodology is adopted in order to interact in detail so that data storage, management and storage archives of any entity can be created.
