<p> I am an data scientist with a passion for sports and people. </p>


<p> I currently work at IBM as a Senior Data Scientist within the Advanced Analytics practice. Before working as a data scientist, I taught 12th grade Economics at a charter School in the South Bronx. In order to transition into a career in data science, I completed the <a href="http://www.thisismetis.com/">Metis Data Science bootcamp </a> where I was able to develop my skills in Python, Sql, D3, and Git while building end-to-end data analysis pipelines (acquisition, storage, analysis, modeling, and visualizations).   </p>
